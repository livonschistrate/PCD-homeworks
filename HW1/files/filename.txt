Concurrency is a technique of programming that allows multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously. 
It enables processes to overlap in time, allowing faster completion time and increased efficiency. 
It is often used to take advantage of multi-core processors or to speed up long-running tasks, such as data streaming. 
Concurrent programming makes use of threads, semaphores, and locks to coordinate shared resources and ensure the correct execution of processes.

Distributed computing is a type of computing in which resources, such as data and applications, are shared by multiple computers connected through a network. 
This allows for improved data processing speed, scalability and availability, as well as redundancy. 
It can also be used to store data and run applications on a larger scale than a single machine can handle.

Problem solving and programming go hand in hand. 
In problem solving, a person or program defines the problem, analyzes what the problem entails, creates a strategy to solve it, implements the strategy, and verifies if the solution meets the desired goal. 
Programming is the process of writing code to solve the problem. 
When programming, a person or program breaks down the task into smaller steps and then expresses those steps in a programming language. 
Both problem solving and programming require an understanding of the application domain, necessary logic, and the language used.
